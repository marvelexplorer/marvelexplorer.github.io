name: Triathlon
description: After being exposed as a steroid user and stripped of his awards, gifted
  sprinter Delroy Garrett Jr. sought new direction in the Triune Understanding, a
  philosophical movement that preaches the fulfillment of one's innate potential by
  balancing various aspects of environment and self, after which he developed a superhuman
  triple-powered physique, and, believing the Triune teachings had unlocked his latent
  powers, Garrett became the costumed hero Triathlon and celebrity spokesman for the
  Triune Understanding.
