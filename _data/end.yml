name: Star-Lord (Peter Quill)
description: Refusing to miss his opportunity, Peter Jason Quill stole a scoutship
  from Cape Canaveral, returned to Eve, and shot his way to the appointed spot, where
  his old rival Harrelson, NASA's choice to be Star-Lord, was awaiting selection,
  where Quill was transported away in his stead, and transformed into Star-Lord.
