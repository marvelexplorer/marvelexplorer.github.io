name: Venom (Ultimate)
description: 'While Eddie Brockâ€™s academic career seemed to take off, his personal
  life was in shambles due to his quick temper and inability to connect with women
  on any level, and Eddie became isolated, but when his old friend Peter Parker contacted
  him, he felt a rush of enthusiasm: here, at last, was someone with whom he could
  truly bond.'
