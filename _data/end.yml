name: Shard
description: Shard and her older brother Bishop were raised in the 21st Century, some
  eighty years into an alternate future, by their grandmother, in a timeline in which
  the X-Men were betrayed by one of their own and killed, causing a disaster that
  caused the government to place a stylized 'M' tattoo over the left eyes of all mutants.
