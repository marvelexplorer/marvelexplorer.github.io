name: Thor
description: "As the Norse God of thunder and lightning, Thor wields one of the greatest
  weapons ever made, the enchanted hammer Mjolnir.\r\nWhile others have described
  Thor as an over-muscled, oafish imbecile, he's quite smart and compassionate.  He's
  self-assured, and he would never, ever stop fighting for a worthwhile cause.\r\n\r\n"
