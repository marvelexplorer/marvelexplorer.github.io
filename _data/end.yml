name: Unus
description: Angelo Unuscione is a mutant whose powers did not surface until adolescence,
  when he first used them as a school bully and later as a small time criminal before
  immigrating to America and using his ability to create a virtually impenetrable
  force field around himself to launch a career as a flamboyant, invincible costumed
  wrestler known by the stage name of Unus the Untouchable.
