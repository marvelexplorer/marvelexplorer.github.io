description: 'After a battle with Onslaught left the world without the majority of
  the heroes that made it feel safe, Baron Zemo devised a plan like no other in order
  to rule the world. Zemo gathered Beetle, Fixer, Goliath, Moonstone, and Screaming
  Mimi, all former members of the Masters of Evil, together to disguise themselves
  as a new heroic team in order to take advantage of the missing heroes and gain the
  trust of the authorities and public in general. '
