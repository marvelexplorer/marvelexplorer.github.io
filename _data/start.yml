name: Tiger Shark
description: A champion Olympic swimmer, Todd Arliss earned nearly half million dollars
  in advances for public exhibitions, but his dreams came crashing down around him
  when he injured his back and legs while rescuing a man who had fallen overboard
  from a private craft, sending Arliss into the arms of Dr. Lemuel Dorcas, who used
  his "morphotron," which could imprint the genetic pattern of an animal onto a human,
  turning Arliss into a superhuman, amphibious creature.
