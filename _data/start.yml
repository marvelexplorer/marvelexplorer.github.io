name: Wolverine
description: Born with super-human senses and the power to heal from almost any wound,
  Wolverine was captured by a secret Canadian organization and given an unbreakable
  skeleton and claws. Treated like an animal, it took years for him to control himself.
  Now, he's a premiere member of both the X-Men and the Avengers.
