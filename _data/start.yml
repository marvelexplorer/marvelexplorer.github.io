name: Wild Child
description: Kyle Gibney's mutant powers emerged at an early age and left him with
  a freakish appearance, horrifying his parents, who kicked him out of the house,
  where he was eventually found and experimented upon by the Secret Empire and, later,
  Department H, who dubbed Gibney Wild Child and placed him with Gamma Flight, the
  entry-level team whose recruits can eventually graduate to Alpha Flight.
