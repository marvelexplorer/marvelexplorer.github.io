name: Wasp
description: When Janet Van Dyne's father died, she convinced her father's associate
  Hank Pym to give her a supply of "Pym particles"; Pym also subjected her to a procedure
  which granted her the ability to, upon shrinking, grow wings and fire blasts of
  energy, which she called her "wasp's stings."
