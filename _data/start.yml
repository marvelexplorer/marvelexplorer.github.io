name: Toad
description: British-born Mortimer Toynbee, abandoned by his parents so early in childhood
  that he cannot remember them, was placed in an orphanage where the other children,
  who regarded him as a freak due to his ugliness, his unusual physique and his leaping
  ability, continually tormented him.
