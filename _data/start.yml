name: Daredevil
description: Abandoned by his mother, Matt Murdock was raised by his father, boxer
  "Battling Jack" Murdock, in Hell's Kitchen. Realizing that rules were needed to
  prevent people from behaving badly, young Matt decided to study law; however, when
  he saved a man from an oncoming truck, it spilled a radioactive cargo that rendered
  Matt blind while enhancing his remaining senses. Under the harsh tutelage of blind
  martial arts master Stick, Matt mastered his heightened senses and became a formidable
  fighter.
